# This is a non functioning mockup. Just a GUI
This is a mockup/concept of an app called ETS2/ATS Lane Assist 
This version of the app is non-functional and probobaly never will be functiong (Update: ???)
The app is a basic GUI using customtkinter
Again, this app is non-functional and only serves a purpose for my learming of Python GUI's
A functional version of this prgoram made by Tumppi066 is available at:

# Requirments
You will need Python 3.9 or up (Probobaly will not work on 3.11 or above (I have found 3.9.13 to work the best)
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3913/

You will also need the ltest version of Git for Widnows
https://gitforwindows.org/

# How to install, its easy
1. Download the latest version from the Releases tab (install.py)
2. Place install.py where ever you want it to be installed
   ```
   You should place this in a folder with:
   -No Spaces
   -No Special Charchters
   -Not in OneDrive
   ```
   The structure should look like this
   ```
   -Root (Folder that you place install.py in)
     -install.py (Refer to step 1)
     -Lane_Assist_Mockup (Folder wil be created upon installation and contains the app)
	 ```

4. Open install.py and follow installation instructions.
   The installer will first install any required dependencies and modules.
   It will then download the program for this GitHub page and place them in the Lane_Assist_Mockup folder.
