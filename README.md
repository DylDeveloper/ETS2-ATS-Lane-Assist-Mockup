# This is a non functioning mockup. Just a GUI
This program is not going to do anything regarding lane assist.
If you want functionallity, go to Tumppi066's ETS2 Lane Assist project: 
https://github.com/Tumppi066/Euro-Truck-Simulator-2-Lane-Assist.
What I have made is simply a mockup of a design for the prgoram, it has limited functionallity and is just for show.

# Installation
1. Install Python <br>
   You will need a Python version above 3.9 and a version below 3.11, anything outside of that range will not work. <br>
   3.10 is the reccomended version: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/
3. Install Git <br>
   Git is needed for the installation of the program. <br>
   You can get it here: https://gitforwindows.org/
5. Get installation Files
   Go to the releases tab and click the latest version, from the files section, download the "install.py" and "create.py" files
7. Place installation files
   You should make a folder on your PC, make sure that it meets the following criteria:
   - Not in OneDrive
   - No spaces in directory
   - No special charachters in directory
   (These will be checked during install)
8. Run the installer
   Now you can run the installer. This is a list of items, in order, that the installer does.
   - Checks for internet connection
   - Checks for everything listed in step 4
   - Check for Git and Python
   - Check for customtkinter and installs it if it isnt found (You will have to restart the installer only if it installs it)
   - Creates a UI that shows what it does
   - Checks for dependencies (modules) (This can take awhile depending on how many of them are already installed)
   - Checks GitHub connection
   - Downloads the app files and places them in a folder
   - Installs Roboto font to your PC
   - Creates run.py and update.py to run the app easier <br>
   
   (You can find a full list of modules that are installed in the Dependencies tab)

# Usage 
Just use run.py to open the app, use update.py to update the app when a new commit is made

# Dependencies
The following is every dependency that the app installs. Make sure you trust the authors of all of them. <br>
tkinter, customtkinter, readchar, sys, os, colorama, webbrowser, webview, keyboard, matplotlib, canvas, time, traceback, PIL, ImageTK

# Credits
This project is made by DylDeveloper and is registered under an MIT License <br>
All credits go to Tumppi066, he made the real ETS2 Lane Assist program and inspired me to start coding. <br>
Of course thanks to the developers of the modules. <br> 
I had a ton of fun making this program, and I cant wait to spend hours more making 2.0.

EDIT: I have since become a developer for the actual ETS2LA program. Looking back at the code for this project, it really, really sucks. When I made this I barely knew what a function was. I will no longer be maintaining this project and 2.0 will never happen unless I get bored.
