The app is a basic GUI using customtkinter
Again, this app is non-functional and only serves a purpose for my learming of Python GUI's

# How to install, its easy
1. Download the latest version from the Releases tab (install.py)
2. Place install.py where ever you want it to be installed
   ```
   You should place this in a folder with:
   -No Spaces
   -No Special Charchters
   -Not in OneDrive
   ```
   The structure should look like this
   ```
   -Root (Folder that you place install.py in)

     -Lane_Assist_Mockup (Folder wil be created upon installation and contains the app)

   It will then download the program for this GitHub page and place them in the Lane_Assist_Mockup folder.
